            <p>A micro team, with giant dreams. </p>


            <h1>CHARITY FOCUSED</h1>

            <p>
                We are Banaware, focused on giving charities and shelters the coverage and exposure they deserve. In a world where the bad word spreads like wildfire, we aim to give the good word an even greater power. 
            </p>

            <h1>HAPPY FACES SAY A THOUSAND WORDS</h1>

            <p>
                How many times have you wanted to help, or talk to someone with a helping hand, but couldn't find the right person to do so?
               
                <br>

                "Too often" is what we always hear, and that's why we are here to create easy-to-reach online platforms, that encourage interactions between the general public and the charity/shelter workers.
    
                <br>

                By implementing FREE donations, everyone with a bit of spare time can watch an ad to give these small groups the support and love they deserve.
